# java-problems-functions-
In this repositary i solve the some java question that is include the functions and method :
  1 .Make a function to check if a number is prime or not.
  2.Make a function to check if a given number n is even or not.
  3.Make a function to print the table of a given number n.
  4.Read about Recursion.
    Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
    Each recursive function must have:
    Base condition → stops the recursion
    Recursive call → function calls itself
    Example (Recursion – Factorial)
